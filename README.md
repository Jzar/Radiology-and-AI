Summary of ML models

The intended tasks include:
- Automatic segmentation of brain metastasis/tumors and edema (swelling) 
- Prediction of tumor type (multiclass classification)
- Prediction of immunotherapy response (binary classification)
- Prediction of tumor pseudoprogression vs true tumor progression

The intended models to do these tasks include deep convolutional neural network based architectures, including deep residual networks. Transfer learning will be used. It is expected that this large dataset will result in superior performance compared to previous similar work.
